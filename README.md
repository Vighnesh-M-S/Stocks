## Introduction

EasyCall is a web app for meetings, chats and collaborate at one place. It is built using React for frontend, Express , Sockets server and Twilio for handling APIs and communication, and Firestore for database.

## üí° Why did I build this?

In the ongoing pandemic, the need for software that allows communication and collaboration in form of screen sharing or live whiteboard has become a necessity. Since the problem was quite widespread and technologically interesting so I decided to make this project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local development

That's pretty easy. To ensure that you are able to install everything properly, we would recommend you to have <b>Git</b>, <b>NPM</b> and <b>Node.js</b> installed.

We will first start with setting up the Local Project Environment:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/apoorvdwi/EasyCall.git
cd EasyCall
npm run dev:install
```
